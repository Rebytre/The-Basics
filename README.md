# The-Basics

Hello there. ðŸ‘‹

This used to be the repository for "HTML-Basics", a website designed to use as notes and a reference
for what HTML elements are commonly used in modern website making and what they do.

This has changed however. I've decided to change this repository into "The-Basics" repository,
and I will henceforth use this repository to not only store "The Basics Of HTML", but also
future guides for different languages such as Python, GoLang, JavaScript, SQL, and 
a wide variety of other programming languages that I've yet to learn.

I hope that this repository will not only help me, but that it will also help others in their
programming journeys.

Happy coding!
