                <p>
                    In JavaScript, you can create or declare variables by using one of three keywords:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var"</li>
                        <li>"let"</li>
                        <li>"const"</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each keyword has its own characteristics and use cases.
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var" is function scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the function it is declared.</li>
                        <li>"let" is block scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block (a pair of curly braces) it is declared in.</li>
                        <li>"const" is also block scoped, but it cannot be reassigned its value once it is set, with the exception of the constant being an object or an array.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Examples:</h4>
                <pre><code>
// Declaring a variable using "var":
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // Outputs: 10

// Declaring a variable using "let":
let b = 5;
console.log(b); // Outputs: 5

// Declaring a variable using "const":
const apple = "red";
const apple = "green";
console.log(c); // Outputs: "red" (or an error, since there has been an attempt to reassign the variable when it is a constant)
                </code></pre>

                <h2>Variable Scopes:</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to almost any other programming language out there, information is stored within a certain scope, meaning they can only be accessed within a certain area of the code. <br>
                    There are three main scopes in JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global</li>
                        <li>Function</li>
                        <li>Block</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each of them are different in terms of where they can be accessed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global - Can be accessed anywhere within the code. A variable with a global scope can be created by declaring a variable outside of any function or block.</li>
                        <li>Function - Can only be accessed within the function it is declared in.</li>
                        <li>Block - Can only be accessed within the block it is declared in (a block being a pair of curly braces: {}).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Here is what scopes the different variable types can be accessed in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var": function level</li>
                        <li>"let": block level</li>
                        <li>"const": block level</li>
                    </ul>
                    And some questions that may arise:
                    <dl>
                        <dt><i>If you were to declare any variable above its base scope, can you access it in any scope lower than the current scope?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Yes, any scope below that will be able to access that variable, whether it be "let", "var", or "const". For example:
                            <pre><code>
function example() {
    let x = 10 // The variable has a function scope

    if (true) {
        console.log(x + 5) // Despite "x" being in a higher scope, it can still be accessed within a lower scope.
    }
}
                            </code></pre>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
