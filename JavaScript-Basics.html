                <h2>Variable Declarations:</h2>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, you can create or declare variables by using one of three keywords:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var"</li>
                        <li>"let"</li>
                        <li>"const"</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each keyword has its own characteristics and use cases.
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var" is function scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the function it is declared.</li>
                        <li>"let" is block scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block (a pair of curly braces) it is declared in.</li>
                        <li>"const" is also block scoped, but it cannot be reassigned its value once it is set, with the exception of the constant being an object or an array.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Examples:</h4>
                <pre><code>
// Declaring a variable using "var":
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // Outputs: 10

// Declaring a variable using "let":
let b = 5;
console.log(b); // Outputs: 5

// Declaring a variable using "const":
const apple = "red";
const apple = "green";
console.log(c); // Outputs: "red" (or an error, since there has been an attempt to reassign the variable when it is a constant)

            <!--Variable Scopes-->
            <section>

                <h2>Variable Scopes:</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to almost any other programming language out there, information is stored within a certain scope, meaning they can only be accessed within a certain area of the code. <br>
                    There are three main scopes in JavaScript:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global</li>
                        <li>Function</li>
                        <li>Block</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each of them are different in terms of where they can be accessed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global - Can be accessed anywhere within the code. A variable with a global scope can be created by declaring a variable outside of any function or block.</li>
                        <li>Function - Can only be accessed within the function it is declared in.</li>
                        <li>Block - Can only be accessed within the block it is declared in (a block being a pair of curly braces: {}).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Here is what scopes the different variable types can be accessed in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>"var": function level</li>
                        <li>"let": block level</li>
                        <li>"const": block level</li>
                    </ul>
                    And some questions that may arise:
                    <dl>
                        <dt><i>If you were to declare any variable above its base scope, can you access it in any scope lower than the current scope?</i></dt>
                        <dd>
                            Yes, any scope below that will be able to access that variable, whether it be "let", "var", or "const". For example:
                            <pre><code>
function example() {
    let x = 10 // The variable has a function scope

    if (true) {
        console.log(x + 5) // Despite "x" being in a higher scope, it can still be accessed within a lower scope.
    }
}
                            </code></pre>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>

            <!--Variable Hoisting-->
            <section>
                <hr>
                <h2>Variable Hoisting:</h2>
                <p>
                    Variable hoisting refers to when a variable declaration will be compiled when running the code.<br>
                    Only variables defined with "var" will be hoisted to the top of their scope. <br>
                    Any other variables defined with "let" or const will not be hoisted. <br>
                    One thing to note however, is that only the declaration of the variable will be hoisted, and not the initialization. <br>
                    This means that if you try to access a "var" variable before it has been initialized, it will return "undefined".
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
console.log(x); // Outputs undefined, since it has been hoisted but not initialized.
var x = 45;
console.log(x); // Outputs 45, since the variable has now been initialized.

// Replace "var" with "let" or "const" and it will throw an error.

                <h2>Strings:</h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript strings are similar to every other string in other programming languages. <br>
                    They are used to represent text and can be enclosed in single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or backticks (` `). <br>
                    Single quotes and double quotes are functionally the same, but backticks allow for string "interpolation", and multi-line strings. <br>
                    String interpolation allows you to embed expressions or other variables directly withing the string by wrapping the expression or variable in ${}. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let stringa = 'Hello!';
let stringb = "How are you?";
let stringc = `Daniel says: ${stringa} ${stringb}`; //String interpolation

console.log(stringa);
console.log(stringb);
console.log(stringc);

                <p>
                    Booleans are a data type that can only have one of two values: "true" or "false". <br>
                    They are most commonly used in conditional statements and loops to determine whether a block of code should execute. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let exectuteCode = true; // Replace with false to see other output.

if (executeCode) {
    console.log("The code has executed.");

                <h2>Numbers:</h2>
                <p>
                    Numbers in Javascript are used to represent both integers and other similar numberic values. <br>
                    They can be used in any mathematical operations.
                    Here is a list of the different types of number variables:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integers - Whole Numbers eg. 1, 2, 3, ...</li>
                    <li>Floats - Decimal Numbers eg. 1.58, 0.2, 3.14159, ...</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal Notation - Base 16 Numbers eg. 0xff, 0x5a, 0x2b2, ... (Make sure to always start the value with "0x")</li>
                    <li>Binary Notation - Base 2 Numbers eg. 0b1, 0b101011, 0b11111110, ... (Make sure to always start the value with "0b")</li>
                    <li>Exponential Notation - Numbers written in the form of a * 10^b eg. 1.5e2, 7.2e50, 12.2e-10, ... (Make sure to always end the value with "e" followed by the exponent value)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Quick note: Javascript regards all of these values as being a "number" value, meaning if you use a "===" equality comparison operator, it will return true if the values are equal, regardless of the format of the number variable.
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let intnum = 42; // Integer Type
let binarynum = 0b101010; // Binary Notation Type

if (intnum === binarynum) {
    console.log("The two numbers are equal.");
} else {
    console.log("The two numbers are not equal.");
}

            <!--Big Integers-->
            <section>
                <hr>
                <h2>Big Integers:</h2>
                <p>
                    Big integers are a special data type in Javascript that can represent whole numbers larger than the maximum or minimum safe integer values. <br>
                    This is useful when dealing with very large numbers, as regular number types in Javascript can only safely represent integers between -(2^53 - 1) and 2^53 - 1. <br>
                    They are created by appending "n" to the end of an integer value, regardless of how large or small the integer is. <br>
                    You may not add a big integer to any other number type, and vice versa. <br>
                    You may only add big integers to other big integers, so it is key you first convert any other number types to big integers before performing any calculations.
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let bigInt1 = 100000000000000000n; //Big Integer Type.
let bigInt2 = BigInt(0b100010101111011011010110101011110111); //Binary Notation to Big Integer

                <hr>
                <h2>Undefined:</h2>
                <p>
                    The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. <br>
                    If you try to access a variable that is undefined, it will return the value "undefined". <br>
                    Undefined is a placeholder value that indicates the absence of a value, which is different from null, which represents the absence of any value.
                </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let undefinedVar; // Variable has been declared, but has not been assigned any value
console.log(undefinedVar); // Outputs "undefined"

                <hr>
                <h2>Null:</h2>
                <p>
                    Null is a special value in Javascript that represents the absence of any value. <br>
                    While undefined indicated that a variable has been declared but has not yet been an assigned a value, null is used to explicity indicate that the variable has no value. <br>
                    Null also has several interesting properties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Null is an object type, despite being being a placeholder to indicate that the variable has no value.</li>
                    <li>Null is considered falsy.</li>
                    <li>Null acts as 0 in mathematical operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <pre><code>
let nullVar = null; // Given a value of null
console.log (nullVar); // Outputs "null"
console.log (nullVar - 2); //Outputs "-2", since null acts as 0
console.log (typeof nullVar); // Outputs "object"

if (nullVar) {

                    <p>
                        The "typeof" operator is a built-in operator in Javascript that is used to determine the data type of a variable or expression. <br>
                        It returns a string that indicated the type of data being evaluated. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <pre><code>
let variable = undefined; // Change the value of "variable" to see different outputs
console.log(typeof variable); // Prints out the type of the data being evaluated.

                    <h2>Objects:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Objects are a special data type that can contain multiple values within a single object-type variable. <br>
                        They can be created by defining a variable and then putting any following values within curly brackets "{}". <br>
                        Any values within the object must have a comma at the end if another value is added afterwards. <br>
                        For any values over a single word must be put in air quotes. <br>
                        To call upon a object value, you may either call it by using <i>objectname</i>.<b>valuename</b>,<br>
                        or alternatively, in the case that the value is within quotes, you may use <i>objectname</i>["<b>valuename</b>"].
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <pre><code>
let objectVar = {
    name: "Dan",
    age: 12,
    "plays football": true
}

objectVar.name = "Michael";

if (objectVar["plays football"] === true) {
    console.log(objectVar, "hello");

                    <p>
                        Type casting is the process of converting one type of variable to another. <br>
                        This can be done either explicitly or implicitly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example:</h4>
                    <pre><code>
// Converting a number-type to a string-type: (Also explicit type casting example)
let varA = 5100;

varA = string(varA) // Explicitly told to type cast
console.log(varA) // Should return "5100" as a string.

// Implicit Type Casting (Unspecified outcome)
let varB = "hi there";
let varC = 10;
let varBC = varB + varC

console.log(varBC) // Program will most likely convert outcome to string, but it is not explicitly told to convert into a string.
